# Bike-Sales-Data-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyse the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualisation.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project was to analyse sales data using Microsoft Excel to uncover customer and regional trends, and to present actionable insights through an interactive dashboard that supports business decision-making.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, pivot tables, and dashboard design using Excel.

## Dataset used
- <a href= "https://github.com/ayoadej/Bike-Sales-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Bike%20Sales%20Data%20Exploration.xlsx">Bike Sales Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- Which customer demographics generate the highest sales revenue?
- How do sales vary by region and product category?
- What trends can be observed in purchasing behaviour?
- Which segments contribute most to overall performance?

## Process
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and corrected inconsistent data entries.
- Standardised column formats (e.g. dates, categories, numeric values).
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency to make the dataset analysis-ready.

2. Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
- Created pivot tables to summarise sales across key dimensions such as region, customer demographics, and product categories.
- Used filters and slicers to enable dynamic exploration of the data.
- Identified trends, patterns, and high-performing segments.

3. Dashboard Development
- Designed an interactive Excel dashboard to visualise KPIs and trends.
- Used charts and pivot visuals to present insights clearly and intuitively.
- Built the dashboard to support quick, data-driven decision-making by stakeholders.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Dashboards
- Data Cleaning & Transformation

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end use of Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation. By transforming raw sales data into clear, interactive insights, the project highlights how Excel can be effectively used to support data-driven decision-making in a business context.
